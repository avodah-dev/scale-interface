# Next Steps & Commitments - UQSA Scale Project

## Immediate Actions (You/Nate)

### 1. Create Proposal Package
**Deliverables to Send:**
- Visual workflow diagrams showing both assembly and sorting processes
- User interface mockups for station touchscreen
- Physical hardware recommendations with images
- Two implementation options with different approaches
- Initial cost estimate for single station pilot

**Timeline:** Within 1-2 weeks of meeting

### 2. Technical Validation
- Research their existing scale models for integration compatibility
- Confirm WiFi infrastructure requirements
- Validate piece-counting accuracy capabilities with their part types
- Prepare equipment specifications for pilot station

## Phase 1: Pilot Implementation

### Scope
- **Single Station Setup:** One complete system (scale + interface + software)
- **Test Duration:** 1-2 weeks minimum
- **Station Selection:** Use most trusted employee/station for initial trial
- **Both Workflows:** Test both assembly and sorting modes

### Pilot Objectives
- Validate technical accuracy against manual counting
- Confirm user interface usability with actual employees
- Test real-time data reporting and dashboard functionality
- Identify any workflow adjustments needed
- Gather employee feedback and training requirements

### Success Criteria
- Accuracy within Â±2% of manual counts
- Employee adoption without significant workflow disruption
- Real-time data visibility working as expected
- Kimmy and team approval to proceed with full rollout

## Client Commitments (UQSA)

### Immediate (Kimmy)
- **Review Proposal:** Evaluate workflow diagrams and cost estimates
- **Infrastructure Assessment:** Confirm WiFi coverage in production area
- **Station Selection:** Identify best station/employee for pilot
- **Part Number Data:** Provide Jenny's part number list with production targets

### For Pilot Phase
- **Scale Inventory:** Determine how many additional scales needed
- **Employee Communication:** Prepare staff for pilot testing
- **Production Scheduling:** Allocate time for pilot testing without disrupting operations
- **Feedback Collection:** Gather input from Jake, Crystal, and floor employees

## Phase 2: Full Rollout (Contingent on Pilot Success)

### Scope Estimate
- **12+ Stations:** Complete system for all production stations
- **Training Program:** Comprehensive employee training
- **Integration:** Full connection with Sue's reporting spreadsheets
- **Advanced Features:** Scrap tracking, advanced analytics

### Planning Requirements
- Final station count and configuration
- Installation scheduling to minimize production impact
- Change management for transition from paper-based system
- Ongoing support and maintenance planning
