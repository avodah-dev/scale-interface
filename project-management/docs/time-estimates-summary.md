### Critical Path Items

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (1 day) - Blocks everything
2. **Electron Foundation** (1 day) - Blocks station features
3. **Data Sync Development** (1 day) - Blocks dashboard
4. **First On-site Visit** (1 day) - Validates approach

### Cost Breakdown (Estimated)

| Category                  | Hours | Rate  | Cost     |
|---------------------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Lead-Engineer             | 40    | $175  | $7,000   |
| Engineer                  | 144   | $150  | $21,600  |
| Hardware (screens/setup)  | -     | -     | $3,900   |
| **Total**                 |       |       | **$32,500** |

*Note: Rates are placeholders - adjust based on actual team rates*
*Hardware: ~$300 per station x 13 stations*

### Risk Areas & Mitigation

| Risk                          | Impact | Mitigation              | Buffer   |
|-------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| Serial communication issues   | High   | Already tested          | 0.5 day  |
| WiFi outage handling          | Medium | Phase 2 offline mode    | 0.5 day  |
| Database sync conflicts       | Medium | Simple sync design       | 0.5 day  |
| User training challenges      | Low    | On-site support         | 0.5 day  |

### Recommended Team Structure

**Primary Structure:**
- 1 Lead-Engineer (5 days) - Sets up infrastructure, dashboard foundation, and Electron architecture
- 1 Engineer (18 days) - Implements all features, handles integration, and performs on-site deployments
- Lead-Engineer available for questions throughout project

**Timeline Options:**
- Sequential: 5-6 weeks (Lead does setup, then Engineer takes over with Lead support)
- Parallel: 3-4 weeks (Lead and Engineer work concurrently)

### Development Breakdown by Role

| Component                    | Lead-Engineer | Engineer | Total    |
|------------------------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Hardware Setup**           | -            | 1.5 days | 1.5 days |
| **Infrastructure & Dashboard Setup** | 4 days | -        | 4 days   |
| **Electron App**             | 1 day        | 1 day    | 2 days   |
| **Station Interface**        | -            | 2 days   | 2 days   |
| **Data Sync**                | -            | 2.5 days | 2.5 days |
| **Dashboard Features**       | -            | 8 days   | 8 days   |
| **On-site Deployment**       | -            | 4 days   | 4 days   |

### Next Steps for Approval

1. Review epic breakdown with tech lead
2. Confirm resource availability
3. Finalize hardware vendor for screens
4. Lock in Phase 1 start date
5. Define success metrics for each phase
6. Set up development infrastructure (Day 1 task)
