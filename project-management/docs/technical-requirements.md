# Technical Requirements

Critical considerations and requirements for the 13-station scale interface system.

## Sterling 7600 Protocol

### Communication Specifications
- **Port Settings**: 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, 5s timeout
- **Pinout**: Pin 2 (TX), Pin 3 (RX), Pin 5 (Ground)
- **Commands**: 3-letter commands + CR
  - `SGW\r` - Gross weight
  - `SNW\r` - Net weight
  - `SCO\r` - Piece count
  - `SPW\r` - Piece weight
  - `ZRO\r` - Zero scale
  - `ATW\r` - Auto tare
  - `SRP\r` - Print ticket
  - `SVN\r` - Firmware version

### Response Formats
- Weight: `"Gross 100.55 lb.<cr><lf>"`
- Count: `"Count 157 Pieces<cr><lf>"`
- Piece Weight: `"Piece Weight 0.6350 lb.<cr><lf>"`

### Error Handling
- Scale error codes: `Err.80`, `Err.81`
- Status conditions: `ULULUL`, `OLOLOL`, `-------`
- Timeout handling
- Connection loss recovery
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## System Requirements

### Performance
- Sub-2-second response times for all operations
- Polling interval: 1000ms (configurable 500-10000ms range)
- <5% packet loss tolerance
- Automatic reconnection within 10 seconds

### Data Validation
- Input validation for all user entries
- Bounds checking for weight and count values
- Format verification for scale responses
- Completeness checks for data packets

### Offline Resilience
- Core requirement: maintain data integrity during network outages
- Local data buffering with SQLite WAL mode
- Automatic synchronization when connection restored
- Queue management for pending uploads

### Security
- Secure API authentication
- Encrypted data transmission
- Employee ID validation
- Role-based access control for dashboard

### Monitoring & Support
- Structured logging for field support
- Remote troubleshooting capabilities
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error reporting and alerting

## Hardware Requirements

### Per Station
- USB-to-RS232 adapter (FTDI-based)
- Touchscreen device (Android tablet or Raspberry Pi)
- Reliable power supply
- Network connectivity (WiFi or Ethernet)

### System-Wide
- Central server for data aggregation
- Backup adapters for redundancy
- Network infrastructure supporting 13+ devices
- UPS for critical components

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Development Phases
- Phase 1-2: macOS development environment
- Phase 3: Windows/Linux deployment targets
- Testing required on all target platforms

### Platform-Specific Issues
- Serial port permissions (Linux/macOS)
- USB driver compatibility (Windows)
- Path handling differences
- Process management variations

## Scalability Requirements

### Current Scope
- 13 production stations
- 1 supervisor dashboard
- Single facility deployment

### Future Expansion
- Design for 50+ stations
- Multi-facility support
- Cloud-based aggregation
- Enterprise integration capabilities
