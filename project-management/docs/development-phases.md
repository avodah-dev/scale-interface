# Development Phases

Complete documentation of project phases from prototype to production deployment.

## Phase 1a: Console-Based Testing - Mock Scale (✅ COMPLETED)

**Status**: All success criteria met and validated with mock scale simulation
**Runtime**: Node.js with TSX for TypeScript execution

### Success Criteria Achieved
- ✅ **Connection**: Establish serial connection within 10 seconds (achieved: 105ms with mock)
- ✅ **Communication**: Send command and receive response in <2 seconds (achieved: ~102ms with mock) 
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle 7+ error scenarios (achieved: 10/10 scenarios with simulation)
- ✅ **Data Capture**: Log 100+ scale readings with structured timestamps (achieved: 110+ mock readings)
- ✅ **Configuration**: Change all settings via config.json without code changes (full validation system)
- ✅ **Recovery**: Automatically reconnect after connection loss (tested with mock disconnections)
- ✅ **Performance**: Maintain <5% packet loss during extended test (achieved: 0.9% with mock)

### Validation Commands
- `pnpm start --mode=testing --diagnostics` (quick mock test)
- `node testing-archive/validate-success-criteria.js` (comprehensive mock validation)
- `pnpm start --mode=testing --time=60` (extended mock polling test)
- `pnpm run typecheck` (TypeScript validation)
- `pnpm run check` (Biome linting and formatting)

## Phase 1b: Console-Based Testing - Real Hardware (✅ COMPLETED)

**Status**: Successfully tested with Gearmo FTDI adapter
**Goal**: Test console application with actual RS-232 hardware using office equipment

### Test Plan Executed
1. Connect Gearmo FTDI adapter to available RS-232 device
2. Run hardware diagnostics: `pnpm start --mode=scale --diagnostics`
3. Test actual serial communication vs mock responses
4. Validate FTDI adapter auto-detection and connection
5. Test error handling with real hardware timeouts and disconnections
6. Document actual vs simulated response timing and behavior
7. Test loopback communication with null modem adapter

### Hardware Setup
- Gearmo USB-to-Serial FTDI adapter (primary)
- CableMax RS-232 LED tester (signal verification and diagnostics)
- DB9 null modem adapter (for loopback testing)
- MacBook Pro M2 Max (development platform)

### Outcomes
- Validation of real serial communication vs mock simulation
- FTDI adapter compatibility and performance confirmation
- Real-world timing and error handling validation
- Confidence in hardware approach before client site visit

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test with real hardware (FTDI adapter required)
pnpm start --mode=scale --diagnostics
pnpm start --mode=scale --time=300

# Compare real vs mock data
grep "scale_reading" logs/scale-data-*.log | tail -20

# Code quality checks
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format
```

## Phase 2: Client Site Validation with Sterling 7600 (✅ COMPLETED 2025-08-19)

**Status**: Successfully validated all Sterling 7600 functionality at client site
**Goal**: Validate console application with actual Sterling 7600 scales

### Test Plan
1. Deploy tested console application to client site
2. Connect to actual Sterling 7600 scale (DB-9 serial port)
3. Validate Sterling 7600 specific protocol implementation
4. Capture and document actual Sterling 7600 data formats
5. Test all Sterling 7600 commands (SGW, SNW, SCO, SPW, ZRO, ATW, SRP, SVN)
6. Document any Sterling 7600-specific protocol adjustments needed
7. Assess communication reliability for project estimation confidence

### Actual Outcomes (2025-08-19)
- ✅ Sterling 7600 protocol validated (with command echo discovery)
- ✅ Performance: 0% packet loss, <30ms response times
- ✅ Perfect stability in client environment
- ✅ 100% confidence for Phase 3 full system development
- ✅ Count tracking works perfectly (tested up to 19 pieces)
- ✅ Firmware version 4.31.0 identified

## Phase 3: Full Multi-Station System Development (PLANNED)

### Per Station Components
- Android tablet application (touchscreen UI)
- Employee ID sign-in system
- Part number entry and target tracking
- Real-time scale data collection via USB-to-Serial
- Local data buffering for network resilience

### Central System Components
- Central database for all station data
- Master monitoring dashboard for supervisors
- Real-time aggregation of all 13 stations
- Part number to target count mapping
- Employee productivity tracking
- Historical reporting and analytics

### Technical Challenges
- Android USB serial communication permissions
- Multi-station data synchronization
- Network reliability in industrial environment
- Offline operation with automatic sync
- Real-time updates to master dashboard
- Scale USB connection to Android tablets

### Success Criteria
