- **Immediate Goal**: Build console test app with current hardware to validate approach
- **Timeline**: Console testing → Client site validation → Full system development (if contracted)

## Phase 1: Today - Console-Based Testing Setup

### Objective

### Deliverables
- **Console application** that can send/receive serial data
- **Testing mode** with simulated scale responses
- **Scale mode** for real scale communication
- **Data format capture** and logging capabilities
- **Error handling** and connection diagnostics

### Technical Requirements
- Use **Gearmo USB-to-Serial Adapter** for connection
- Implement **node-serialport** for serial communication
- Create **configurable parameters** (baud rate, commands, polling frequency)
- Add **LED indicator monitoring** via CableMax tester
- Include **comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting

### Console Application Architecture
```javascript
// Core structure for Phase 1 console app
const SerialPort = require('serialport');
const fs = require('fs');

// Configuration object - to be loaded from config.json
const defaultConfig = {
  serial: {
    baudRate: 9600,
    dataBits: 8,
    stopBits: 1,
    parity: 'none'
  },
  commands: {
    grossWeight: 'SGW\r',    // Send gross weight
    netWeight: 'SNW\r',     // Send net weight  
    count: 'SCO\r',         // Send count (counting mode)
    pieceWeight: 'SPW\r',   // Send piece weight
    zero: 'ZRO\r',          // Zero the scale
    tare: 'ATW\r'           // Acquire tare weight
  },
  polling: {
    interval: 1000,     // 1 second polling
    timeout: 5000,      // 5 second response timeout
    retries: 3          // Failed command retries
  },
  logging: {
    level: 'debug',     // debug, info, warn, error
    format: 'json',     // json or text
    includeRaw: true    // Log raw serial data
  },
  mode: 'testing'       // 'testing' or 'scale'
};

class ScaleCommunicator {
  constructor(config = defaultConfig) {
    this.config = config;
    this.port = null;
    this.logFile = `scale_log_${Date.now()}.json`;
    this.isConnected = false;
    this.polling = false;
  }
  
  async connect() {
    // Connect to serial port with error handling and retries
  }
  
  async sendCommand(command, timeout = this.config.polling.timeout) {
    // Send command with timeout and retry logic
  }
  
  async startPolling() {
    // Continuous polling with configurable interval and error recovery
  }
  
  async handleError(error, context) {
    // Comprehensive error handling with recovery strategies
  }
  
  logCommunication(direction, data, error = null) {
    // Structured logging with timestamps and error context
  }
}
```

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Loopback Testing** - Use DB9 null modem adapter to test communication
2. **LED Monitoring** - Verify signal activity with CableMax tester
3. **Error Simulation** - Test comprehensive error scenarios:
   - Serial port disconnection during operation
   - Sterling 7600 error codes: `Err.80` (data error), `Err.81` (unknown command)
   - Status conditions: `ULULUL` (underload), `OLOLOL` (overload), `-------` (A/D in progress)
   - Timeout scenarios (no response from scale)
   - Malformed responses from scale
   - Buffer overflow conditions
   - Rapid connect/disconnect cycles
   - Power interruption simulation
4. **Performance Testing** - Measure response times and reliability
5. **Data Capture** - Log all communication for analysis

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Phase 1 Risks
- **Serial communication issues** → Use CableMax tester for diagnostics + backup adapter
- **Driver compatibility problems** → Test with Gearmo adapter thoroughly + verify FTDI drivers
- **Data format complexity** → Implement comprehensive logging + structured parsing
- ~~**Sterling 7600 protocol unknown**~~ → ✅ **Manual obtained** - Commands and responses documented
- **Hardware failure during client visit** → Thorough pre-testing + portable diagnostics
- **Configuration errors** → Extensive config validation + default fallbacks
- **Cross-platform compatibility** → Test on Windows VM before deployment

### Phase 2 Risks
- **Scale communication failure** → Bring backup tools and adapters
- **Client access limitations** → Prepare for quick testing scenarios
- **Data format surprises** → Capture everything for later analysis

### Phase 3 Risks
- **Cross-platform compatibility** → Test early on target hardware
- **Performance issues** → Optimize for real-time requirements
- **Deployment complexity** → Plan for gradual rollout
