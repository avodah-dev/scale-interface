## Raw Serial Data Formats

### Count Command Response Variations

#### Standard Format (Most Common)
```
Command Sent: SCO\r
Response: SCOCount      15 Pieces\r\n
```

Response: OCount      15 Pieces\r\n
```
*Note: Sometimes the 'SC' prefix is dropped, leaving just 'O'*

### Weight Command Responses

#### Gross Weight
```
Command Sent: SGW\r
Response: SGWGross   0.010 lb\r\n
Alternative: WGross   0.010 lb\r\n
```

#### Net Weight
```
Command Sent: SNW\r
Response: SNWNet    -0.915 lb\r\n
```

## Key Observations

### Response Timing
- Average response time: 20-30ms
- No timeouts observed during testing
- Consistent 1-second polling achieved

### Data Integrity
- 100% packet delivery (0% loss)
- All commands acknowledged
- No corrupted data observed

### Count Tracking Performance
- Successfully tracked incremental additions (1-2 pieces at a time)
- Jump detection working (e.g., 8 ‚Üí 13 pieces)
- Stable readings when no changes
- Change indicators (‚Üë) functioning correctly

### Protocol Variations
1. **Command Echo**: Scale echoes the command in most responses
2. **Prefix Variations**: 'OCount' vs 'SCOCount' for same data
3. **Negative Values**: Supported for both weight and count
4. **Firmware Specific**: Version 4.31.0 behavior may differ from manual

## Integration Notes for Station Development

### Serial Communication
- Baud: 9600, 8N1 confirmed working
- Response terminator: \r\n (CR+LF)
- Command terminator: \r (CR only)
- Buffer management needed for split packets

### Parser Requirements
- Handle command echo variations
- Support both 'SCOCount' and 'OCount' formats
- Parse negative values for tare/count scenarios
- Fallback to 'raw' type when format unrecognized

### Android Considerations
- USB OTG support required for FTDI adapter
- Serial permissions needed (android.permission.USB_PERMISSION)
- Consider using library like usb-serial-for-android
- Test connection stability during tablet sleep/wake cycles

### Real-time Updates
- 1-second polling optimal for piece counting
- Change detection logic working well
- Consider WebSocket for station ‚Üí master communication
- Buffer readings during network interruptions
