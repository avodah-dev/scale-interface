**Product**: Oxsubor SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Male to Female Extension Data Cable  
**Type**: Right-angle USB extension cables  
**Product Link**: [Amazon](https://a.co/d/2b4ojU0)

## Description
Short USB 3.0 extension cables with right-angle connectors designed to protect USB devices from damage when plugged directly into ports. Provides strain relief and reduces wear on both the device port and the adapter connector.

## Key Features
- **USB 3.0 SuperSpeed** - Backward compatible with USB 2.0
- **Right-angle connectors** - Reduces strain and protrusion
- **Short lengths** - 20cm (8 inch) typical
- **Male to Female extension** - Acts as protective intermediary
- **2-pack options** - Redundancy for critical connections
- **Left and right angle options** - Flexibility in cable routing

## Use Cases for This Project
- **Protect Gearmo adapter** - Prevent damage from accidental bumps
- **Reduce port wear** - On both Raspberry Pi and adapter
- **Cable management** - Cleaner installation in SmartiPi case
- **Strain relief** - Prevents stress on USB connections
- **Professional appearance** - Tidier cable routing
- **Safety improvement** - Less protruding hardware to snag

## Benefits for Scale Interface Stations
1. **Durability** - Protects expensive USB-to-serial adapters
2. **Reliability** - Reduces connection failures from port damage
3. **Maintenance** - Easier to replace cable than adapter
4. **Installation** - Allows better positioning of adapters
5. **Safety** - Minimizes protruding hardware hazards

## Integration with Station Hardware
- **With SmartiPi case**: Routes USB cleanly inside case cavity
- **Raspberry Pi protection**: Preserves USB ports on Pi board
- **Gearmo adapter**: Allows secure mounting away from direct port
- **Cable management**: Right-angle keeps cables close to case

## Cost Analysis
| Item | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| USB Extension Cables | 15 sets | ~$10-15 | ~$150-225 |

## Specifications (Typical)
- **USB Standard**: USB 3.0 (5 Gbps)
- **Backward Compatible**: USB 2.0, USB 1.1
- **Cable Length**: 20cm / 8 inches
- **Connector Type**: Type-A male to female
- **Angle Options**: 90-degree left or right
- **Color**: Usually black or blue

## Why This Matters for Industrial Deployment
1. **Accidental damage prevention** - Workers may bump into equipment
2. **Vibration resistance** - Right-angle reduces leverage on connections
3. **Dust/debris protection** - Easier to seal around angled cables
4. **Replacement economy** - Cheaper to replace cable than adapter
5. **Professional installation** - Looks more finished and intentional

## Installation Notes
- Position adapter in protected location within case
- Use right-angle to route cable along case wall
- Secure cable to prevent movement
- Label each cable for easy troubleshooting
- Keep spare cables on-site for quick replacement

## Recommended Configuration
- One extension cable per station (13 total)
- 2-3 spares for field replacement
- Choose angle direction based on case layout
- Consider color coding for different stations

## Alternative Options
- Straight USB extensions (less protection)
- USB panel mount adapters (more complex installation)
- Direct connection (highest risk of damage)
