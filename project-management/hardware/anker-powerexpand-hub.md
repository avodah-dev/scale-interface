## Description
A compact, plug-and-play USB-C hub designed to expand connectivity for modern laptops. Connects via a built-in 0.6 ft USB-C cable and offers seven ports for enhanced connectivity and data transfer capabilities.

## Key Features
- **4K@30Hz HDMI port** for external displays (limited to 2K for 60Hz)
- **USB-C Power Delivery (PD) port** (up to 60W input, 48W pass-through charging)
- **USB-C data port** (5 Gbps) for high-speed data transfer
- **Two USB-A 3.0 ports** (5 Gbps) for legacy device connectivity
- **SD/microSD card readers** (UHS-I, 104 MBps) for data storage
- **1 Gbps Ethernet port** for stable wired internet connection
- **Compact design** (4.6 x 2.1 x 0.6 inches, 4.4 oz) for portability
- **Durable aluminum/polycarbonate build** for reliability

## Functionality
- **Port expansion** for MacBook Pro's Thunderbolt 4 ports
- **Simultaneous use** of all ports (900mA combined current limit)
- **No drivers required** for plug-and-play operation
- **Power delivery** with pass-through charging capabilities
- **Data transfer** via USB-A and USB-C ports
- **External display support** via HDMI for monitoring

## Use Cases for This Project
- **Port expansion** for connecting multiple serial adapters to MacBook Pro
- **External display connectivity** for monitoring scale data on larger screens
- **Ethernet connection** for stable network connectivity during development
- **USB-A ports** for connecting Gearmo USB-to-serial adapter
- **SD/microSD card readers** for data logging and transfer from serial devices
- **Power delivery** for charging MacBook Pro during extended development sessions
- **Multiple device connectivity** for testing various serial communication scenarios
- **Backup connectivity** when direct Thunderbolt ports are occupied

## Compatibility with Project Tools
- **Gearmo USB-to-Serial Adapter**: Compatible via USB-A 3.0 ports
- **CableMax RS-232 Tester**: Works in conjunction with Gearmo adapter through hub

- **Power delivery** to maintain MacBook Pro charge during extended sessions
- **Compact and portable** design for fieldwork and on-site testing

## Known Limitations
- **HDMI limited to 4K@30Hz** (DP 1.2) - may not support high refresh rates
- **No Thunderbolt support** - limited to USB-C data transfer speeds
- **USB-C data port doesn't support video** - HDMI port required for displays
- **Tight USB-A ports** - may require careful insertion of adapters
- **Occasional Ethernet dropouts** reported by some users
- **Pass-through charging (48W)** may not suffice for power-hungry M2 Max workloads
- **900mA combined current limit** for high-power devices

## Project-Specific Notes
- Provides essential port expansion for MacBook Pro development
- USB-A ports enable Gearmo adapter connection
- Ethernet port useful for stable cloud connectivity during testing
- External display support helpful for monitoring scale data streams
