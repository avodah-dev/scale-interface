### Per-Station Hardware Requirements
Each of the 13 stations will require:
1. **USB-to-Serial Adapter** - Gearmo or equivalent FTDI-based
2. **Station Device** - Android tablet or Windows/Linux computer
3. **Mounting Solution** - Wall/desk mount for tablet
4. **Power Supply** - For continuous operation
5. **Network Connection** - Wi-Fi or Ethernet

### Central System Requirements
1. **Database Server** - Cloud or on-premise
2. **Network Infrastructure** - Reliable connectivity
3. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Central display for supervisors
4. **Backup Systems** - Redundancy for critical components

## Hardware Selection Criteria

### USB-to-Serial Adapters
**Why FTDI Chipset:**
- Industry-standard reliability
- Cross-platform driver support
- Proven Sterling 7600 compatibility
- LED indicators for diagnostics
- Surge protection capabilities

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Prolific chipset adapters - driver issues on some platforms
- CH340 adapters - less reliable for 24/7 operation
- Built-in serial ports - not available on modern devices

### Station Devices
**Android Tablets (Preferred for Phase 3):**
- Cost-effective at scale (13 units)
- Touch interface for operator ease
- USB OTG support for serial adapters
- Wall-mountable form factor
- Long-term availability

**Alternatives:**
- Windows mini PCs - higher cost, more complex
- Raspberry Pi - requires custom housing
- Industrial terminals - significantly higher cost

## Compatibility Matrix

| Component | macOS | Windows | Linux | Android |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| Gearmo FTDI | ✅ Native | ✅ Auto | ✅ Built-in | ✅ OTG |
| CoolTerm | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Node.js App | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Future Electron | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Android App | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Deployment Considerations

### Hardware Redundancy
**Critical Components:**
- USB-to-Serial adapters - 20% spare ratio (16 total for 13 stations)
- Tablets - 2 spare units minimum
- Network equipment - redundant paths
- Power supplies - UPS for critical stations

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Standardize on single adapter model
- Pre-configure spare units
- Document replacement procedures
- Train on-site personnel

### Environmental Factors
**Manufacturing Floor Conditions:**
- Temperature: 60-90°F typical
- Humidity: Variable
- Dust/debris: Moderate to high
- Vibration: From nearby equipment
- Electrical noise: Industrial environment

**Hardware Requirements:**
- Industrial-grade enclosures for tablets
- Sealed USB connections
- Surge protection on all devices
- Regular cleaning protocols

### Scalability Planning
**Phase 3 - 13 Stations:**
- Initial deployment configuration
- Centralized monitoring capability
- Basic redundancy implementation

**Future Expansion:**
- Modular architecture for adding stations
- Network capacity for 20+ stations
- Database scalability considerations
- Monitoring system extensibility
