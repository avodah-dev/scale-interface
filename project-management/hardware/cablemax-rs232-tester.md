## Description
A compact, plug-and-play device designed for testing and troubleshooting RS-232 serial connections. Features a DB-9 male connector on one end and a DB-9 female connector on the other, allowing it to connect in series with any 9-pin RS-232 interface.

## Key Features
- **No external power or drivers required** - ideal for on-the-go testing
- **Plug-and-play installation** for quick setup and use
- **Compact size** (1.77 × 1.38 × 0.82 inches) for portability
- **Universal compatibility** with RS-232 DB-9 and DB-25 configurations
- **Operating system support**: Windows (98, ME, XP, 2000, 2003, CE, Vista, 7, 8), Linux, and Mac OS 10.X
- **Data transfer rate** up to 200 Kbps
- **Surge protection** in some models with transient voltage suppressors (TVS)
  - 600W peak pulse power dissipation
  - ±30V breakdown voltage

## Functionality
- Monitors status of serial connections using dual-color LEDs
  - Red for logic LOW
  - Green for logic HIGH
- LEDs flash to indicate activity on eight signal lines:
  - DCD (Data Carrier Detect)
  - RXD (Receive Data)
  - TXD (Transmit Data)
  - DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
  - DSR (Data Set Ready)
  - RTS (Request To Send)
  - CTS (Clear To Send)
  - RI (Ring Indicator)

## Use Cases for This Project
- **Verify Sterling 7600 scale RS-232 connectivity** before deploying stations
- **Test USB-to-RS232 adapter functionality** and signal integrity
- **Diagnose communication issues** between scale and station devices
- **Validate pinout connections** (Pin 2: Transmit, Pin 3: Receive, Pin 5: Ground)
- **Monitor data transfer activity** during scale polling operations
- **Troubleshoot connection problems** in the field

## Known Limitations
- Metal overlay or retaining nuts may detach when unscrewed for direct device connection
- LEDs may appear dim to some users (though others report bright, clear indicators)
- Female screw holes on both sides can complicate direct connections to devices with similar screw configurations, sometimes requiring gender changers

## Project-Specific Notes
- Essential for Phase 1b hardware testing and Phase 2 client site validation
- Provides visual confirmation of data flow without requiring software
- Can remain inline during normal operation for continuous monitoring
