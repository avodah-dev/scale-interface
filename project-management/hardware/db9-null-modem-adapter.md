## Description
A compact, plug-and-play device designed to convert standard straight-through RS-232 serial cables into null modem cables by crossing over transmit (TXD), receive (RXD), and select handshake lines (e.g., RTS/CTS, DTR/DSR). Features a DB-9 male connector on one side and a DB-9 female connector on the other, enabling direct communication between two DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) devices without requiring a modem.

## Key Features
- **Plug-and-play functionality** requiring no external power or drivers
- **Compact, low-profile design** reduces leverage strain on ports and saves space (often under 0.5 inches long)
- **Gold-plated contacts** ensure reliable, durable connections with minimal signal loss
- **Shielded construction** protects against EMI/RFI interference for stable data transfer
- **UL-grade 94V-0 insulator** meets flammability standards for safety
- **Wide compatibility** with devices requiring RS-232 COM port connections
- **Data transfer rates** typically support up to 230 Kbps or higher
- **Removable screws/nuts** allow easy adaptation for direct device connections or cable extensions

## Functionality
- **Crosses over signal lines**: TXD, RXD, and select handshake lines (RTS/CTS, DTR/DSR)
- **Enables DTE-to-DTE communication** without requiring a modem
- **Converts straight-through cables** into null modem cables
- **Supports legacy equipment** and industrial devices requiring null modem connections

## Use Cases for This Project
- **Testing scale communication** by creating null modem connections for loopback testing
- **Connecting two station devices** for data transfer or synchronization testing
- **Troubleshooting serial connections** when direct DTE-to-DTE communication is needed
- **Repurposing existing straight-through cables** for null modem applications
- **Console access** to network equipment or industrial devices requiring null modem connections
- **Legacy equipment integration** for devices that require null modem connections
- **Backup communication method** if direct scale-to-device connection fails
- **Development and testing** of serial communication protocols

## Known Limitations
- Some units may have overly long or misaligned screw posts, complicating connections to certain ports
- Rare reports of non-functional units, though replacing the adapter typically resolves issues
- Gender-specific needs can lead to ordering errors (e.g., needing female-to-female instead), requiring additional gender changers

## Project-Specific Notes
- Useful for Phase 1b hardware testing when no scale is available
- Can create loopback testing scenarios with Gearmo adapter
- Provides alternative testing method if Sterling 7600 unavailable
