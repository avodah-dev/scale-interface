## Description
A reliable, plug-and-play device designed to add a serial RS-232 port to computers lacking native serial support. Ideal for connecting legacy devices like PDAs, GPS units, modems, and industrial equipment. Features a USB 2.0 interface (Type-A or Type-C variants) and a DB-9 male connector, with dual-color LED indicators to monitor signal activity.

## Key Features
- **Plug-and-play installation** with no external power required, powered via USB
- **Wide compatibility** with Windows (7, 8, 10, 11), Linux, and Mac OS X (10.6 and above)
- **Automatic driver installation** in most cases
- **LED activity monitoring** for real-time diagnostics, aiding troubleshooting of serial connections
- **Surge protection** up to 15kV to safeguard devices from static and voltage spikes
- **Compact design** available in various lengths (12, 16, 36 inches, or 5 feet) for portability and flexibility
- **Supports full RS-232 signals**, including hardware handshaking (e.g., RTS/CTS)
- **High-speed data transfers** up to 921.6 Kbps
- **FTDI chipset** ensuring stable performance and superior driver stability

## Functionality
- **Dual-color LED indicators** (typically red for TX, green for RX) to monitor signal activity
- **Monitors signal lines**: TXD, RXD, DTR, DSR, RTS, CTS, and GND
- **Hardware handshaking support** making it suitable for industrial applications
- **High-performance FTDI chipset** (FT232R or FT232RL) for reliable communication

## Use Cases for This Project
- **Primary USB-to-RS232 adapter** for connecting Sterling 7600 scale to station devices
- **Real-time communication monitoring** via LED indicators during scale polling
- **Reliable driver support** across Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X for cross-platform deployment
- **Industrial-grade reliability** for 24/7 operation in manufacturing environments
- **Hardware handshaking support** for robust communication with industrial scales
- **Surge protection** to safeguard expensive scale equipment from electrical damage
- **Multiple cable length options** for flexible installation in different station layouts
- **USB-C variant support** for modern devices and future-proofing

## **CRITICAL: Order Backup Unit**
⚠️ **Action Required**: Order a second Gearmo adapter immediately for:
- **Client site redundancy** - Essential backup if primary unit fails during validation
- **Development continuity** - Prevent project delays due to hardware failure
- **Cross-platform testing** - Test on multiple platforms simultaneously
- **Field deployment** - Spare units for 13-station deployment

## Known Limitations
- LEDs may be dim or all amber, making it hard to distinguish signals in some units
- The translucent case sticker can obscure indicators if misaligned
- Some users find the price slightly high for the design, though it's justified by performance

## Project-Specific Notes
- Currently have only ONE adapter - single point of failure
- Validated with Phase 1a mock testing, ready for Phase 1b hardware testing
- FTDI chipset auto-detected on macOS without manual driver installation
- Serial port typically appears as `/dev/tty.usbserial-*` on macOS
