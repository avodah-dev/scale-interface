# Digital Scale Integration System
## Production Tracking Solution for UQSA Manufacturing

---

## Executive Summary

We propose a phased implementation of a digital scale integration system that will transform UQSA's production tracking from manual paper-based recording to real-time digital monitoring. This system will provide immediate visibility into production rates, eliminate data entry errors, and free your quality team to focus on value-added activities rather than manual counting and recording.

Our solution directly addresses the challenges identified during our discovery meeting:
- **Eliminates** manual paperwork burden on employees
- **Provides** real-time production visibility (not next-day reporting)
- **Calculates** accurate parts-per-hour metrics automatically
- **Supports** both Assembly and Sorting workflows
- **Scales** to all 13 production stations

---

## Proposed Solution

### System Overview

Each production station will be equipped with:
- **Raspberry Pi-based touchscreen terminal** (7" display)
- **Direct connection** to your existing Sterling 7600 scales
- **Real-time communication** with central monitoring dashboard
- **Local data buffering** for network resilience

### Key Features

✅ **Simple 3-Step Station Setup**
1. Employee enters ID
2. Selects part number
3. Begins production with live monitoring

✅ **Core Metrics Display**
- Current scale reading (pieces)
- Production rate (pieces/hour)
- One-touch "Record Count" button

✅ **Management Dashboard**
- Real-time view of all 13 stations
- Color-coded performance indicators (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Click any station for detailed production graphs
- Export data for existing Excel workflows

## Why This Approach Works

### Phased Implementation Reduces Risk
- Start small with pilot station
- Prove value before full deployment
- Incorporate feedback from real usage
- Build confidence with your team

### Addresses Your Specific Needs
- **For Kimmy:** Real-time visibility into production issues
- **For Crystal:** Eliminate manual counting burden
- **For Sue:** Automated hourly reports in Excel-friendly format
- **For Employees:** Simple interface with minimal workflow disruption

### Based on Proven Technology
- Sterling 7600 scales are industry-standard
- Raspberry Pi platform is reliable and cost-effective
- Similar system successfully deployed for golf ball sorting
- All components are commercially available and supported

## Success Metrics

We will measure success by:
1. **Accuracy:** System counts match manual verification (>99%)
2. **Adoption:** All stations actively using system within 2 weeks
3. **Time Savings:** Crystal gains 4+ hours/day for quality tasks
4. **Data Quality:** Zero manual data entry errors
5. **Visibility:** Production issues identified within minutes, not next day
