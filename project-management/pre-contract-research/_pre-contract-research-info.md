# Pre-Contract Research & Validation

This directory contains all validation work completed before contract award, demonstrating the technical feasibility and approach for the UQSA scale integration system.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Mock Scale Testing
**Location**: `mock-scale-testing/`

Built a TypeScript console application to validate our approach without hardware dependencies. This phase proved our ability to:
- Establish serial communication protocols
- Handle Sterling 7600 command/response formats
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Validate performance requirements

**Key Files**:
- `testing-archive/` - Complete test suite with mock scale simulation
- `phase-1b-results.md` - Hardware adapter validation results

### Phase 2: Sterling 7600 Live Validation (2025-08-19)
**Location**: `sterling-7600-validation/`

Successfully validated all functionality with actual Sterling 7600 scales at client site:
- ✅ 100% command compatibility confirmed
- ✅ 0% packet loss over extended testing
- ✅ <30ms response times achieved
- ✅ Count tracking validated (tested up to 19 pieces)

**Key Files**:
- `CLIENT_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference for scale testing
- `site-test-procedure.md` - Detailed test procedures
- `pre-flight-checklist.md` - Equipment and preparation checklist
- `client-visit-20250819.md` - Complete validation results
- `logs/` - Actual scale communication logs from site visit

## Validation Results

All critical success criteria met:
1. **Connection**: Established within 10 seconds ✅
2. **Communication**: Sub-second command/response ✅
3. **Reliability**: <1% packet loss achieved ✅
4. **Error Handling**: 10+ scenarios validated ✅
5. **Data Capture**: 100+ readings logged ✅
6. **Recovery**: Auto-reconnect functional ✅

## Technology Validated

- **Hardware**: Gearmo FTDI USB-to-Serial adapter
- **Protocol**: RS-232 at 9600 baud, 8N1
- **Commands**: SGW, SNW, SCO, SPW, ZRO, ATW, SRP, SVN
- **Platform**: TypeScript/Node.js console application
- **Performance**: Real-time response capability confirmed

## Lessons Learned

1. Sterling 7600 echoes commands in responses (discovered during live test)
2. FTDI adapters provide reliable USB-to-Serial conversion
3. Mock testing accurately predicted real hardware behavior
4. Console approach sufficient for protocol validation

## Next Steps

This validation provides 100% confidence for full system development with:
- 13 station deployment capability
- Real-time data collection proven
- Hardware approach validated
- Protocol implementation complete
