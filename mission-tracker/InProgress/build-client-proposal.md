# Mission: Build Client Proposal

## Objective
Create comprehensive proposal for UQSA manufacturing scale system implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clear pricing for 13-station system
- [ ] Phased implementation timeline
- [ ] Hardware specifications and costs
- [ ] Software deliverables outlined
- [ ] ROI/value proposition articulated

## Context Documents
- `client-meeting-notes/20250819/meeting_summary.md` - Client requirements
- `client-meeting-notes/20250819/technical_requirements.md` - Technical specs
- `project-overview.md` - System architecture
- `phase-1b-results.md` - Testing validation

## Approach
1. Review client meeting outcomes
2. Define system architecture for both workflows (Assembly & Sorting)
3. Estimate development timeline
4. Calculate hardware costs
5. Structure pricing model
