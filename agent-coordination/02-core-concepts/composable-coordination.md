# Composable Coordination - The Multiplier Effect

## Core Concept

Individual patterns provide value alone, but when combined they create synergistic benefits. Think of it as 1+1+1=5, not 3.

## The Patterns That Compose

### Foundation Layer
1. **Navigation (CLAUDE.md)** - Agents find what they need
2. **Documentation (_info.md)** - Context is organized
3. **Mission Tracking** - Work is clear and trackable

### When Used Alone
Each pattern helps:
- Navigation alone: Agents find files faster
- Documentation alone: Less confusion about code purpose
- Missions alone: Clear work queue

### When Composed Together
The magic happens when patterns connect:
- Navigation **points to** missions
- Missions **reference** documentation  
- Documentation **links back** to navigation
- Each strengthens the others

## Real-World Example

From the bond-calculator project (Level 4 maturity):

### Without Composition (Early Stage)
- Agent asks "Where is the calculation logic?"
- You explain it's in `core/calculations/`
- Agent asks "What should I work on?"
- You explain the current task
- Agent asks "How does this connect to other parts?"
- You provide context
- **Result**: Multiple rounds of clarification

### With Composition (After Implementation)
- CLAUDE.md routes: "For calculations" → `_financial-mechanics.md`
- Info file shows: "Bond math" → `calculations/bond-math.ts:45-89`
- Mission spec includes: "Context: See `_financial-mechanics.md`"
- **Result**: Agent completes task in 2-3 interactions

## The Composition Patterns

### Pattern 1: Navigation + Documentation
```markdown
CLAUDE.md: "For API issues" →
_api-info.md: "Authentication" →
auth-handler.ts:23-67
```
**Benefit**: Direct path from problem to code

### Pattern 2: Missions + Context
```markdown
Mission: "Add user validation"
Context Package: [Links to relevant docs]
Acceptance Criteria: [Clear success metrics]
```
**Benefit**: Everything needed in one place

### Pattern 3: Documentation + Missions + Navigation
```markdown
Bug reported →
CLAUDE.md guides to area →
Mission created with context →
Documentation updated after fix →
Navigation improved for next time
```
**Benefit**: Continuous improvement loop

## How to Build Composition

### Start Simple (Week 1)
- Add CLAUDE.md for basic navigation
- Create first mission manually
- Write one _info.md file

### Connect Them (Week 2)
- Make CLAUDE.md reference missions
- Have missions link to _info.md files
- Update _info.md to point back to CLAUDE.md

### Let It Grow (Month 1)
- Notice which paths are traveled most
- Strengthen frequently-used connections
- Add shortcuts for common workflows

### Advanced Composition (Month 3+)
- Specialized paths for different agent types
- Context packages that pre-bundle information
- Mission templates with built-in navigation

## Signs It's Working

You'll know composition is succeeding when:
- Agents complete tasks with fewer questions
- Documentation updates trigger mission creation
- Navigation paths evolve based on usage
- New patterns emerge from combining existing ones
- Session success rate improves significantly

## The Key Insight

**Don't optimize individual patterns in isolation.** The real value comes from how they work together. A mediocre navigation system that connects well beats a perfect one that stands alone.

## Quick Start Composition

In your first session with an AI, say:
```
"I've set up CLAUDE.md, mission tracking, and info files. 
Help me connect them so they work together effectively."
```

The AI will help you:
- Add cross-references between files
- Create connection points
- Build reinforcing loops
- Identify missing links

*Remember: Start with individual patterns, but always be looking for ways to connect them. The connections are where the magic happens.*
