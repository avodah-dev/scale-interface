# Changelog - Agentic Engineering Coordination Framework

All notable changes to the starter kit and framework are documented here.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-04 - Philosophical Coherence Release

### Added
- **`philosophy/starter-kit-philosophy.md`** - DNA model and foundations not prescriptions principle
- **`philosophy/connection-guidelines.md`** - How to maintain philosophical connections
- **`02-core-concepts/composable-coordination.md`** - Explains 1+1+1=5 pattern composition
- **Three-Tier Philosophical Foundation** - Explicit hierarchy in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- **DNA Markers in Templates** - Comments showing maturity level activation
- **Composable Coordination Examples** - Real patterns from bond-calculator project

### Enhanced
- **CLAUDE.md (Main Project)** - Added philosophical hierarchy and learning flow
- **Starter Kit README** - Added three-tier philosophy section
- **CLAUDE.md.template** - Added DNA markers and composability hints
- **Assessment** - Added connection patterns check and composability scoring
- **first-prompt.md** - Mentions composable patterns for multiplied benefits

### Philosophy Alignment
- Every framework now includes "Philosophy Alignment" section
- External analyses validate/challenge philosophies
- Starter kit only includes philosophically aligned patterns
- Clear flow: Philosophy → Analysis → Frameworks → Starter Kit

### Key Improvements
- **Conceptual Coherence** - Everything traces back to philosophy
- **Composable Coordination** - Documented how patterns work together
- **DNA Model** - Explicit about dormant features that activate with maturity
- **Connection Guidelines** - Maintainable philosophical alignment

### Framework Maturation
- Frameworks explicitly state which maturity levels they serve
- Integration sections show composable coordination with examples
- DNA Seed sections explain what goes in starter kit and why

## [0.6.0] - 2025-01-14

### Added
- **`starting-prompt.md`** - Clear entry point with copy-paste prompts for immediate use
- **`core-concepts.md`** - One-page philosophy overview explaining the five levels
- **`toolkit-reference.md`** - Comprehensive menu of patterns with skeleton templates
- **`emerging-patterns.md`** - Living lab for patterns observed but not yet formalized
- **Mission Metrics Pattern** - Simple tracking template for complexity and effectiveness
- **Bond-Calculator Analysis** - Level 4 maturity leap documentation showing framework validation

### Enhanced
- **Starter Kit README** - Reorganized with three clear pathways (prompt-only, minimal, full)
- **Tool Documentation Guidance** - Added as optional quality-of-life improvement
- **Framework README** - Added reference to emerging patterns
- **External Analysis** - New bond-calculator maturity leap analysis (Level 3→4 in 6 days)

### Key Improvements
- Starter kit now has clear entry point for users who don't know where to start
- All new files properly connected and referenced in documentation
- Progressive disclosure approach - complexity revealed only when needed
- Validated patterns from bond-calculator project incorporated

### Framework Validation
- Bond-calculator project achieved Level 4 maturity, validating core principles
- Complex calculations now complete in 2-3 interactions (vs many sessions)
- Demonstrates infrastructure investment has compound returns

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-13

### Initial Release Components

#### Core Philosophy
- **Five Levels of Agentic Maturity** - Comprehensive framework from autocomplete to autonomous
- **Human-Agent Coordination Principles** - Complementary strengths philosophy
- **Reference-First Documentation** - Context window optimization strategies

#### Starter Kit
- **Initialization Prompt** - AI-driven assessment and setup
- **Progressive Assessment** - Adaptive evaluation based on project state  
- **Quickstart Templates** - Copy-paste CLAUDE.md and mission-tracker
- **Examples** - Working patterns from real projects
- **AGENTIC_COORDINATION Template** - Full coordination guide structure

#### Frameworks
- **Documentation Infrastructure** - Traversable, agent-optimized patterns
- **SDLC Process Integration** - Structured development lifecycle
- **Context Optimization** - Efficiency strategies for problem complexity
- **Agent Specialization** - Multi-agent handoff patterns
- **Validation Systems** - Quality assurance approaches

#### Project Analysis
- **External Analysis System** - Structured approach to learning from other projects
- **Bond-Calculator Analysis** - Initial Level 3 maturity assessment
- **Pattern Extraction** - Methodology for identifying successful patterns

### Foundation Features
- Maturity assessment methodology (Levels 1-5)
- Project-specific roadmap generation
- Success metrics definition
- Anti-pattern documentation approach
- Mission tracker workflow concepts

### Known Limitations (Addressed in 0.6.0)
- No clear starting point for new users
- Missing connection between philosophy and practice
- Toolkit patterns not easily discoverable
- No simple metrics tracking

## Version History Summary

- **0.7.0** (Current) - Philosophical coherence with composable coordination
- **0.6.0** - Enhanced usability with clear entry points and validated patterns
- **0.5.0** - Initial framework with philosophy, starter kit, and assessment tools

## Upgrade Guide

### From 0.6.0 to 0.7.0
1. Review `philosophy/starter-kit-philosophy.md` for DNA model
2. Check `02-core-concepts/composable-coordination.md` for pattern composition
3. Update templates to include DNA markers (see CLAUDE.md.template)
4. Ensure patterns are connected (navigation → missions → documentation)
5. Use new assessment scoring for composability

### From 0.5.0 to 0.6.0
1. Add `starting-prompt.md` as primary entry point
2. Review `core-concepts.md` for simplified philosophy
3. Browse `toolkit-reference.md` for new skeleton templates
4. Consider mission metrics pattern for tracking progress
5. Check emerging-patterns.md for cutting-edge practices

The 0.6.0 release focuses on making the framework immediately actionable while maintaining depth for those who want it.
