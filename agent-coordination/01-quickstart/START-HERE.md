# ðŸš€ START HERE - Your First 10 Minutes

## One Simple Path to Success

### Minute 1-2: Understand the Goal
You're adding "coordination DNA" to your project so AI assistants can help more effectively. Think of it like adding street signs to a city - agents need to know where things are and what's happening.

### Minute 3-5: Copy ONE Thing
Go to `quickstart/` folder and copy just the CLAUDE.md template to your project root. That's it. One file.

### Minute 6-8: Use This Exact Prompt
Open your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) and paste:

```
I just added a CLAUDE.md file to my project based on the Agentic Engineering Coordination starter kit.

My project: [2-3 sentence description]
Main folders: [list your main code folders]

Please help me:
1. Customize the CLAUDE.md for my specific project
2. Create my first mission in a simple format
3. Show me one concrete improvement we can make right now

Keep it simple - I want to see value immediately.
```

### Minute 9-10: Do the First Task
The AI will suggest something specific. Do it. See the immediate benefit.

## What Just Happened?

You planted a seed. The CLAUDE.md file contains "DNA" that will grow as your project matures:
- **Today**: Simple navigation help
- **Next Week**: Mission tracking
- **Next Month**: Specialized patterns
- **Eventually**: Multi-agent orchestration

## Your Next Steps (When Ready)

### After Your First Success (Day 2-3)
1. Add mission tracking: Copy `quickstart/mission-tracker/` folder
2. Create your first _info.md file for your busiest code folder
3. Let the AI help you identify patterns

### After a Week
- Use `initialization-prompt.md` for a formal assessment
- The AI will tell you your "maturity level" and suggest improvements
- Pick the easiest improvement and do it

### After a Month
- Review `core-concepts.md` to understand the theory
- Browse `examples/` to see what's possible
- Your project will tell you what it needs next

## File Guide (Reference Only)

**For Different Moments:**
- `START-HERE.md` - You are here! Day 1 guidance
- `quickstart/` - Copy-paste templates
- `starting-prompt.md` - Alternative first prompts
- `initialization-prompt.md` - Formal assessment (use after a week)
- `progressive-assessment.md` - How the assessment adapts
- `core-concepts.md` - The philosophy (read when curious)
- `examples/` - See mature patterns in action

## Remember

**You don't need to understand everything today.** The beauty of this system is that it grows with you. Start with one file (CLAUDE.md), see immediate value, then add more as needed.

The DNA is already there - it just needs time to express.

*Confused? Skip everything above and just copy `quickstart/CLAUDE.md` to your project, then ask your AI assistant to help customize it. That's literally all you need for Day 1.*
