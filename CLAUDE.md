## Project Overview

This is a scale-based workstation system project for industrial manufacturing environments. The goal is to create 13 identical stations where employees can:

- Sign in with employee ID on touchscreen devices
- Enter project/part IDs to activate stations
- Monitor real-time metrics from Sterling 7600 industrial scales via RS-232 serial communication
- Display metrics: total counts today, counts this hour, expected per hour, average per hour
- Upload data to cloud database with offline resilience

## Development Phases

### Phase 1a: Console-Based Testing - Mock Scale (âœ… COMPLETED)
**Status**: All success criteria met and validated with mock scale simulation
**Runtime**: Bun 1.2 with full npm compatibility
**Ready for**: Phase 1b hardware testing with office equipment

Built a comprehensive Node.js/Bun console application with:

```javascript
// Configuration structure - load from config.json
const defaultConfig = {
  serial: {
    baudRate: 9600,
    dataBits: 8,
    stopBits: 1,
    parity: 'none',
    timeout: 5000
  },
  commands: {
    grossWeight: 'SGW\r',    // Send gross weight
    netWeight: 'SNW\r',     // Send net weight
    count: 'SCO\r',         // Send count (counting mode)
    pieceWeight: 'SPW\r',   // Send piece weight
    zero: 'ZRO\r',          // Zero the scale
    tare: 'ATW\r',          // Acquire tare weight
    print: 'SRP\r',         // Send formatted data output
    version: 'SVN\r'        // Send firmware version
  },
  polling: {
    interval: 1000,     // 1 second, configurable
    timeout: 5000,      // Response timeout
    retries: 3          // Failed command retries
  },
  logging: {
    level: 'debug',
    format: 'json',
    includeRaw: true
  },
  mode: 'testing'       // 'testing' or 'scale'
};
```

### Phase 1b: Console-Based Testing - Real Hardware (âœ… COMPLETED)
**Status**: Successfully tested with Gearmo FTDI adapter (no scale hardware needed for this phase)
**Goal**: Test console application with actual RS-232 hardware using office equipment
**Available Hardware**: Gearmo USB-to-Serial adapter, CableMax LED tester, DB9 null modem adapter

**Phase 1b Test Plan**:
1. Connect Gearmo FTDI adapter to available RS-232 device (any scale or RS-232 equipment)
2. Run hardware diagnostics: `bun start --mode=scale --diagnostics`
3. Test actual serial communication vs mock responses
4. Validate FTDI adapter auto-detection and connection
5. Test error handling with real hardware timeouts and disconnections
6. Document actual vs simulated response timing and behavior
7. Test loopback communication with null modem adapter if no scale available

**Hardware Setup for Phase 1b**:
